          IUTDS hopes to surpass all others as Bangladesh&apos;s top debate
          organization. It wants all of these accomplishments to be proud
          symbols for Bangladesh as well as IUT. The name IUTDS will come with
          fame. It aspires to be the best club, where everyone feels like a
          family member. <br />
          <div className="mt-3"></div>
          IUTDS is comparable to a giant tree from which people can obtain
          oxygen, shelter, food, and a sense of tranquility in addition to
          fertilizing the tree to help it grow. As the tree gets bigger and
          bigger, so do people&apos;s opportunities. The tree grows to be the most
          prominent and most noticeable, which causes pride. <br />

          IUTDS is a big platform for unleashing brilliance not only in the
          sector of debate but also in many other sectors. By joining IUTDS our
          confidence is elevated to a higher level. We can foster our knowledge
          and also create a big picture of society or any thoughts that involve
          our understanding that the coin also has two sides. IUTDS is the
          stagnation of manifestation in one&apos;  s sagacity. Debaters can explore
          themselves as a renewed person. Engaging in debates helps participants
          analyze complex issues, evaluate different perspectives, and form
          logical arguments. Debaters may weigh evidence, identify fallacies,
          and consider counterarguments, all of which foster critical thinking
          skills applicable beyond debates. IUTDS generates huge opportunities
          to connect with like-minded individuals, mentors, and experts in the
          field you&apos;re debating about. Strong debate skills can be valuable in
          academic settings, job interviews, negotiations, and any scenario
          where effective communication is crucial. Analytical thinking gives us
          the ability to view things widely; it presents a dynamic floor that
          gives input as efficiency. Our research and critical thinking build
          different perceptions of different things, which also propagate a new
          model and provide a platform for you to advocate for causes you
          believe in and potentially influence others&apos; opinions, making you a
          more effective leader and advocate.
