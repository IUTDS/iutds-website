          IUTDS hopes to surpass all others as Bangladesh&apos;s top debate
          organization. It wants all of these accomplishments to be proud
          symbols for Bangladesh as well as IUT. The name IUTDS will come with
          fame. It aspires to be the best club, where everyone feels like a
          family member. <br />
          <div className="mt-3"></div>
          IUTDS is comparable to a giant tree from which people can obtain
          oxygen, shelter, food, and a sense of tranquility in addition to
          fertilizing the tree to help it grow. As the tree gets bigger and
          bigger, so do people&apos;s opportunities. The tree grows to be the
          most prominent and most noticeable, which causes pride. <br />

          IUTDS is a big platform for unleashing brilliance not only in the
          sector of debate but also in many other sectors. By joining IUTDS our
          confidence is elevated to a higher level. We can foster our knowledge
          and also create a big picture of society or any thoughts that involve
          our understanding that the coin also has two sides. IUTDS is the
          stagnation of manifestation in one&apos; s sagacity. Debaters can
          explore themselves as a renewed person. Engaging in debates helps
          participants analyze complex issues, evaluate different perspectives,
          and form logical arguments. Debaters may weigh evidence, identify
          fallacies, and consider counterarguments, all of which foster critical
          thinking skills applicable beyond debates. IUTDS generates huge
          opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals, mentors, and
          experts in the field you&apos;re debating about. Strong debate skills
          can be valuable in academic settings, job interviews, negotiations,
          and any scenario where effective communication is crucial. Analytical
          thinking gives us the ability to view things widely; it presents a
          dynamic floor that gives input as efficiency. Our research and
          critical thinking build different perceptions of different things,
          which also propagate a new model and provide a platform for you to
          advocate for causes you believe in and potentially influence
          others&apos; opinions, making you a more effective leader and
          advocate.
