            A recent article by Elle Kaplan defined effective listening as “giving your complete, intentional focus to what someone says, rather than what their words literally mean.” Effective listening requires active listening, which the University of the People defines as “a soft skill that directs the focus from what’s in our head to the words coming from the outside. By being able to focus on what another person is saying, we can understand needs and information more accurately.”

            We all love being listened to, one thing quiet people tend to be good at. The more comprehensively we are listened to, the more we respond. We fall in love with people who listen to us, we vote for people who listen to us, we buy products and services of people who listen to us. Listening is one of the most influencing skill available to us. If you are a quiet soul you are ahead of the game. The act of keeping one’s mouth shut is one of the skills that make us a good listener.

            The great leaders today convey the message-talk less and listen more. If we reflect on any great leader we’ll see that they are adept at reading between lines. They have the uncanny ability to understand what is not said,heard or witnessed. The first rule in communication is to seek understanding before seeking to be understood. Communication is not a one-way street. The big miss for most leaders is they fail to understand the purpose of communication is not to message, but to engage – THIS REQUIRES LISTENING.

            But to develop the skill of listening we shouldn’t just listen to people who agree with us rather actively seek out dissenting opinions and thoughts. We should listen to those that confront us, challenge us,stretch us, and lastly develop us. Benjamin Franklin said, “Speak little, do much.” We’ll find a lot of great talkers, but great listeners are a rare commodity.
