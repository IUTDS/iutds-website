            Speaking is a skill that one must hone to ease through most of their life, be it in a professional setting or personal matters. There are two aspects to speaking. One is stating important things whereas the other is sounding important. Saying important things is of course necessary. However, many would argue that sounding important is more vital. Because oftentimes if you do not sound important people will put their mind on autopilot while you are speaking, even if what you are saying might be significant.

            In this article we will focus more on how to sound important by uncovering the art of speaking. Whether you're delivering a presentation, engaging in a conversation, or addressing a crowd, effective speaking can significantly impact the message you convey. By mastering this art you will be able to speak with such conviction that will captivate your audience.

            Before a speech it is very important to know your audience. Think of it as tailoring the speech for that particular crowd or group of people based on their knowledge on the topic, their demography and interests. The first question that we ask ourselves is what do the audience need? What do they want? And what do they expect?

            When it comes to speaking it is important to have a structure. This structure should never be chucked at the level of words as in never script out word to word. This makes the speech dry and boring. In fact the structure should have freedom within it. A freedom to express yourself through your point of view and wisdom and allow some part of the message to be fueled by your passion.

            Kevin Carroll, a renowned speaker and trainer talks about the “Diamond structure” when it comes to organizing the speech. The Diamond structure starts very focused in the beginning, then in the middle you develop your presentation and finally comes to a tight finish.

            Another popular model that one may inspire from is the Tree Act Play. In this model you will usually have an intro or a hook followed by the objective and expectation of the speech. Then we move on to the main body of the speech which may include insights, stories, anecdotes and case studies. Lastly a summary and diving into the conclusion making sure our objective is fulfilled and expectation is quenched.

            They say it takes about 7 seconds to make the first impression. To make the best of those 7 seconds and engage the audience you need a hook or an attention grabber. While delivering your truth you need to be a storyteller. Be vulnerable and open with personal stories. Visualize the narrative while storytelling. 
        </p>

        <p className='text-lg mx-24 my-4 text-slate-700'>
            A good attention grabber may be starting with a humorous skit. However, be mindful that the humor is relatable to the audience and tasteful. Other attention grabbers or hooks may be a personal narrative or a quote. It is important to provide proper citation and credibility in such cases.

        <p className='text-lg mx-24 my-4 text-slate-700'>
            A study done by Albert Bryan, a professor at UCLA, to understand how much of the meaning of the message comes from the visual, how much of the meaning of the message comes from the vocals and how much of the meaning of the message comes from the actual words. What he discovered was 55 percent of the message comes from what the people see, 38 percent comes from the sounds, volume and inflection and only 7 percent comes from the actual word of the message.  
        </p>

        <p className='text-lg mx-24 my-4 text-slate-700'>
            This isn’t to say that words in the message are not important. Words are clearly important but this study indicates the significance of body language and how you present it. Because your body movement and voice gives a certain gravitas to your speech and elevates it to another dimension.
        </p>
        
        <p className='text-lg mx-24 my-4 text-slate-700'>
            To add that gravitas there are some dos and don’ts. First in terms of voice and tonality, avoid monotonous voices. No one finds monotone or a robotic voice pleasant. Modulation of the voice is helpful here. To help with modulation your mouth and the 11 facial muscles is your best friend. Articulation or opening your mouth by working those 11 facial muscles will extensively improve your delivery and make your voice more profound and coherent.

            Staircase melody technique can also be used to avoid monotone. The technique suggests that we change our voice modulation in a harmonious and gradual flow either in ascending or descending steps representing a stair. It is a versatile tool to make your voice more interesting and emphasize.

        <p className='text-lg mx-24 my-4 text-slate-700'>
            Non-verbal communication holds such power over the attention of the audience. Eye contact is essential here. It helps build a connection with your audience, building trust and credibility. Furthermore it conveys confidence and authority over the speech making it more viable. Asking questions and interacting is always a good idea to fill in those gaps you did not catch on.
        </p>

        <p className='text-lg mx-24 my-4 text-slate-700'>
            Power of Pauses should not be underestimated. “The right words may be effective, but no word was ever as effective as a rightly timed pause” - Mark Twain. Pauses can be an effective attention grabber. When people get zoned out by hearing a lot of speech, a timely pause lets them catch up. It can also change up the pace and be a stepping stone for an important remark.

        <p className='text-lg mx-24 my-4 text-slate-700'>
            Finally, if there is one last bit of general no-brainer advice that I can give you is to practice. It may seem frivolous but practice is what will make you a natural speaker. To quote Dale Carnegie here, “Great speakers are not born, they're trained”. Make sure your speech has an end goal or objective that you want to fulfill through connecting with your audience.
        </p>

            A speech is something that can change the course of one's life or even history. While the statement seems pretentious, speeches like Abraham Lincon’s Gettysburg Address, Martin King Luthers “I have a dream” are proof of the remarkable effect of a speech. Speech is power: speech is to persuade, to captivate, to conquer. One can do all that and more by Mastering the Art of Speaking.
