                All Aboard the Greatness Express. A line that echoes into the
                heart of every freshman as they embark on the journey of debate.
                Greatness Express is the Novice tournament dedicated towards the
                freshmen to ease into the world of debate. To make this
                transition smoother a dedicated series of elaborate and novice
                friendly debate sessions are held. These sessions begin with the
                simple question of what is debate and why do we even want to
                debate then moves on to the structure and format of BP debate,
                argumentation, principles etc. To summarize the sessions are
                your complete armor to move forward fearlessly in the quest of
                greatness in the debating world.

                Each year we as a club look forward to the greatness express to
                introduce our freshman to the world of debating and critical
                thinking. For most it is the first time experiencing what a
                debate tournament is like. For all it is their first time
                experiencing what IUTDS is all about.

                If Ice breaker had another name it would probably be Cafe
                Debate. The most anticipating part of IUT Club Day, where IUTDS
                Alumni and current members engage in exhilarating and more
                importantly fun informal debate. We say informal debate because
                the topics relate to IUT and its people.

                <br />
                “The expression of romantic affection within the confines of the
                tree park (a famous spot in IUT premise) is deemed
                inappropriate” – when you see IUTDS Alumni and the current EC
                debate or rather argue about such a topic with passion and
                showing no barrier tells the freshman that IUTDS is a club where
                expression of your point of view should never be restrained and
                freedom of expression is valued.
