            All Aboard the Greatness Express. A line that echoes into the heart of every freshman as they embark on the journey of debate. Greatness Express is the Novice tournament dedicated towards the freshmen to ease into the world of debate. To make this transition smoother a dedicated series of elaborate and novice friendly debate sessions are held. These sessions begin with the simple question of what is debate and why do we even want to debate then moves on to the structure and format of BP debate, argumentation, principles etc. To summarize the sessions are your complete armor to move forward fearlessly in the quest of greatness in the debating world.
            <br /><br />
            Each year we as a club look forward to the greatness express to introduce our freshman to the world of debating and critical thinking. For most it is the first time experiencing what a debate tournament is like. For all it is their first time experiencing what IUTDS is all about.

            If Ice breaker had another name it would probably be Cafe Debate. The most anticipating part of IUT Club Day, where IUTDS Alumni and current members engage in exhilarating and more importantly fun informal debate. We say informal debate because the topics relate to IUT and its people.
            <br /><br />
            “The expression of romantic affection within the confines of the tree park (a famous spot in IUT premise) is deemed inappropriate” – when you see IUTDS Alumni and the current EC debate or rather argue about such a topic with passion and showing no barrier tells the freshman that IUTDS is a club where expression of your point of view should never be restrained and freedom of expression is valued.
